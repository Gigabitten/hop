Hop around! Eat bugs! Stick to things! All the things you always wanted to do, but never could because you weren't a frog.

The code for this is admittedly pretty bad. It makes sense in most places, but the overall structure is pretty messy compared to how I'd do it if I could do it again. But it does work, which is the most important thing. If it's a bit laggy, try just decreasing your window size a bit. I tested this on some lower-end laptops and that makes a huge difference in performance. I don't think it *would* be an issue, but for some reason it keeps losing webgl and defaulting to canvas, which is much slower. Never was able to fix that.

Pixi.js is this project's only dependency, and it's only a few megabytes. The rest is vanilla JS, and the rendering was vanilla js before I ran into extremely annoying problems with just the canvas. Pixi is only used for making the sprites, in fact - the collision is all in my code. I could have imported a lot more stuff and written half the code and better, but I really wanted to learn how all of it works from the ground up.

There are a few files in the main folder that should help with any confusing aspects of the code, if anybody actually wants to read it. I plan to migrate the code away from Javascript because running things in the browser has a tremendous variety of problems, but I learned a lot about JS on the way!
