Having trouble with something? Code look like nonsense? Terrible bug? Make sure it's none of these.

-it's the responsibility of a collided-with object to push the object that collided with it out, which
 in retrospect may have been a poor decision
 
-remember that checkpoints can be pushed by other objects sometimes! try making it visible by giving
 it a color if it's not working
 
-make sure an object is a member of the right arrays

-are you doing F.thing instead of F.player.thing?

-level loading is pretty spaghetti. The checkpoint creation function is a higher-order function which
 takes a function which is executed when the player collides with it. This was the best way I could
 see to get the scopes to work out such that the place where the checkpoints are defined by convention
 (the main map loading file) would be able to have its code executed when checkpoints are collided
 with.
