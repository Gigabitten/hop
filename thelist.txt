Having trouble with something? Code look like nonsense? Terrible bug? Make sure it's none of these.

-it's the responsibility of a collided-with object to push the object that collided with it out, which
 in retrospect may have been a poor decision
 
-remember that checkpoints can be pushed by other objects sometimes! try making it visible by giving
 it a color if it's not working
 
-make sure an object is a member of the right arrays

-are you doing F.thing instead of F.player.thing?

-is the structure of controls.js annoying to you? don't worry, it is to me too. the only way to fix it is with linera algebra and I don't know enough linera algebra, sorry future me for making you write
 all that four times
